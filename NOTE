Here there are a collection of scripts able to mainly
work on genomes of which you have a fasta and a gtf/gff
file. We make extensive use of bioperl and mysql.

The SCRIPT_example_....sh files are example pipelines
using some scripts from this folder already used to
analyze the promoters of diatoms genomes.

If you want to analyze the promoters on your own genome:

The folders should be organized in the next way:

 GENOME               scripts              sequences



Into the folder 'GENOME' you need to put the fasta with the
genome and the gtf with the annotation.
[KEEP ATTENTION TO THE TYPE!]


Into the folder 'scripts' you need to put the scripts
from this folder.
[REMEMBER TO MODIFY THE NEXT SCRIPTS ACCORDING TO YOUR NAMING:
- CREATE_DB.mysql 
- charts.R 
- charts2.R]


Into the folder 'sequences' you need to put the SCRIPT.sh
modified accordingly to your naming.
